Mother duck was sitting on her eggs and eagerly waiting for them to hatch.
It felt like forever to her. "When are they ever going to hatch ?" she sighed.
"I am getting bored being here all alone with no one to talk to."
Even her husband, Drake did not come to visit very much.

Then, she felt something moved slightly under her body.
She peeked under and saw her eggs starting to crack one by one.
"Oh, my babies are hatching. I am so excited. I can't wait to see what they
look like and take them out." she said. One by one the ducklings came out of their egg shell.
They wobbled a little before they steadied themselves. There were five of them. Mother duck thought they
looked so cute in yellow.

"Come along, my little ones. It is time to meet your daddy."
she said to her ducklings. They followed behind her in a row to the pond.
She saw her husband, Drake, in the pond. She went into the pond and her ducklings followed.
"Drake", she called to him. Come mock here and meet your children.
Drake swam over to meet his children. "They look so cute." he said. "Yes, they sure do."
replied mother duck. "I have named them. This one is called Billy, he's the one with the longer bill.
The second one is called Brawny, he looks like the strongest here. This third little darling is called,
Dizzy. She's the dreamy one. I named the fourth one, Smarty because he is the smartest one. Trixy is the youngest.
She's the tricky one. Daddy duck gave each of them a hug before he had to leave to look for food with the other male ducks.

Mother duck and her ducklings decided to do the same, swim around and look for food. There were plenty
of food in the pond and around it. There were slugs and snails, insects and plants. Mother duck would "up-end"
searching for food in the water. The ducklings thought it was fun and they did the same.
